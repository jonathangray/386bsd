New features:

1. Virtual consoles
2. Modified ioctl interface (mostly video functions)
3. Terminal emulation moved out of co_vga.c. Another terminal emulator
   may be easily integrated (see co_pc3.c for more info)
4. Ioctl interface moved out of co_cons.c, co_kbd.c and co_vga.c. Other
   ioctl call sets (SYSV) may be easily integrated.
6. Preparation for multibyte characters (not fully finished)
7. Preparation for graphics console support (not finished)
8. New keyboard layer with support, allows to switch between two
   sets of key layouts.
9. Low level keyboard support totally rewritten, should be more stable now.
