                         AND SURVEY


     As of 1992, William F. Jolitz, the developer of 386BSD,
will have spent three years working on  this  project,  from
writing  the  initial 386BSD specification and supplying his
own equipment to his present completion of the  first  UNEN-
CUMBERED  SOURCE  BSD  SYSTEM  FOR  THE 386/486.  This first
release, 386BSD Release 0.0, is based on the BSD  Networking
2  Release  (June 1991) from the University of California at
Berkeley, which already included much of the earlier  386BSD
work that Bill had contributed to the University of Califor-
nia for distribution to all interested  parties.   In  addi-
tion,  Bill has made minimal changes to this release to make
the system bootable and operational (see William  F.  Jolitz
and  Lynne  Greer  Jolitz, _M_i_s_s_i_n_g _P_i_e_c_e_s, _D_r. _D_o_b_b_s _J_o_u_r_n_a_l
May-June 1992).

     386BSD Release 0.0 is  intended  by  the  developer  of
386BSD  to be used for educational and research purposes. As
such, the developer of this release is making  it  available
to  the user at no charge, in order to encourage and facili-
tate its use in research and education.  However, 386BSD has
been a costly product to develop and maintain, and continues
to consume enormous resources. As such, the user  may  elect
to make a contribution to defray the cost of development and
to demonstrate support of this project.

     Should you with to make  a  contribution,  return  this
form with your check or money order (suggested contribution:
$50.00US binary and $100.00US source) to

There is no mandatory payment required by the developer  for
use  of  386BSD Release 0.0, nor will there be any mandatory
payment required for the  use  of  any  future  releases  of
386BSD  done  by  the developer.  However, your contribution
would be greatly appreciated.

     Due to the "free" nature of 386BSD Release 0.0, we can-
not  provide  "on-demand" support. 386BSD is an experimental
research system intended  for  exploration  and  study.  The
inclusion of source code allows the creative and industrious
student of operating systems to modify, correct, augment and

otherwise  alter the system in any manner desired.  Reliance
on 386BSD Release 0.0 for other than it's intended  purposes
is specifically discouraged.

     However,  ample  documentation is readily available and
should be obtained.  For users who wish  to  understand  the
386BSD system conceived by William F. Jolitz and Lynne Greer
Jolitz, and developed by William F. Jolitz, we recommend the
user  study  written  references such as the _P_o_r_t_i_n_g _U_N_I_X _t_o
_t_h_e _3_8_6 series (beginning January 1991  _D_r.  _D_o_b_b_s  _J_o_u_r_n_a_l,
USA  and  beginning  June  1991  _U_N_I_X  _M_a_g_a_z_i_n,  Germany) by
William F. Jolitz and Lynne Greer Jolitz, as well  as  other
books on UNIX and the on-line _3_8_6_B_S_D _U_s_e_r _M_a_n_u_a_l before use.
A book discussing the internals  of  386BSD  by  William  F.
Jolitz  and  Lynne  Greer  Jolitz  entitled  _3_8_6_B_S_D _f_r_o_m _t_h_e
_I_n_s_i_d_e-_O_u_t will be available late 1992.

     We do encourage feedback, however, on bug fixes,  prob-
lems  and  solutions  which  arise during configuration, and
improvements to 386BSD Release 0.0. These  changes  will  be
incorporated  back  into the system, and made available once
again to the 386BSD audience, to further  encourage  use  of
this system.

     Please  complete  and return this registration form and
survey via email or regular mail, so we can add you  to  the
list of 386BSD Release 0.0 users.




    Thank you for your support.

     The  developer's  goal  for  386BSD  was  to provide an
advanced operating system for educational and research  pur-
poses on an inexpensive PC platform.  In 1990, CSRG expanded
that goal to encompass an unencumbered release accessible to
anyone.

     release of 386BSD Release 0.0? Why or why not?




2.   Do you think 386BSD Release 0.0 is a good idea? Why  or
     why not?




3.   Do you think that the article series is a good idea?
