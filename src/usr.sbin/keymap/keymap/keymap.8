.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm keymap
.Op Fl l 
.Op Fl t Ns Ar +/-
.Op Fl d Ar delay
.Op Fl r Ar rate
.Op Fl m Ar keyboardmap
.Op Fl s Ar screensave
.Nm keymap

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm keymap
allows listing of current keyboard map (
.Xr kbd 4 ,
) loading of a new keyboard map, and enabling, disabling and modification
of actual key repetition rate and delay.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl l
Displays the current keymap. Notice that when
.Ar keyboardmap 
is given, 
.Fl l
returns the setting before the new map is set.
.It Fl t Ns Ar +/-
This enables (
.Ar +
) or disables (
.Ar -
) the repetition of keys (typematic). Key repetition is a feature 
built into the keyboard itself. After a specified
.Fl delay
the last key that is hold down is repeatedly sent with a specified
.Fl rate.
.It Fl d Ar delay
Specifies the delay after which the last key will be repeated. Valid 
values are 0..3, corresponding to delays of 250,500,750,1000 ms.
.It Fl r Ar rate
Specifies the repetition rate. Valid argument values are 0..31, with
0 being the fastest (~30 keys/sec) and 31 being the slowest (~2 keys/sec).
The formula to translate this value into a rate in nonlinear.
.It Fl m Ar keyboardmap
When this optional argument is given, the keyboard capability database
.Xr keycap 5
is searched for the entry
.Ar keyboardmap
and the corresponding entry is loaded.
.It Fl s Ar screensave
Specifies the timeout value for the screensaver function. The time has to
be given in seconds, e.g. 600 describes a delay of 10 minutes. The
value 0 disables the screen saver entirely. The default value the system
is started with is 10 minutes. Screen saving is suspended when the
XServer (see
.Xr X386
) is active.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/misc/keycap -compact

.Xr kbd 4 ,
.Xr keycap 5
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Keymap
detects several inconsistencies in the
.Xr keycap 5
database. Processing is stopped in case of error. The keyboard remain in
an undefined state. To restore a defined setting, execute
.Bd -literal -offset indent
keymap -m default
