This is the latest codrv console driver (0.1.2). Patchkit -0.2.4 or later
puts the necessary code for support of that in the system.
The code consists of the kernel part in /usr/src/sys.386bsd/i386/isa/codrv/*,
some data files in /usr/share/misc, and an application "keymap" in
/sbin with sources in /usr/src/sbin/keymap/*. Furthermore, a new
header file /usr/include/sys/ioctl_pc.h is installed.

The following things have to be performed to get codrv running in
your system:

1. Compile a kernel with codrv in. There is an example config
   file CODRV available which contains the necessary changes:
   Replace the line "pc0... irq 1 vector pcrint" with

device		co0	at isa? port "IO_KBD" tty irq 1 vector cointr

   Add the option PC3 to get pc3 terminal emulation. In a later version
   there will be other options to get different terminal emulations.
   Add the following lines:

pseudo-device vtemul
pseudo-device vty     4

   The latter gives you four (4) "virtual console terminals"; if you need
   more, increase the number to upto 10. The vty's are switched with
   CTRL-ALT-F1 to CTRL-ALT-F12 by default.

   Build a new kernel.

2. Build and install the keymap application by doing a 
   'make;make install' in /usr/src/sbin/keymap.
   This also builds and installs a library libconsutil.a, which contains
   some public support routines. Since these routines are only
   used by keymap in the moment, you may safely remove the installed 
   library from /usr/lib again.

3. If you have /dev/vga in your /etc/ttys file, replace it back with
   /dev/console. The bug that required this change is no longer present.
   You may also use /dev/ttyv0 (to be created in the next step) as
   a console.
   Go to /dev as root and do 'sh MAKEDEV co0'. Also build virtual
   consoles with 'sh MAKEDEV vtyNN' where NN is the decimal number
   of vtys you have configured.

4. Reboot the system. With the default setting, the system should come up
   printing the system messages in blue color, and identifying itself
   as having the co0 device built in. If you don't like this color, you
   may change this in some defines in /sys/i386/isa/codrv/co_hdr.h.
   If the system hangs after printing the copyright message, try
   hitting some key. If this does not help (and even when you need to
   press a key, send a bug report describing your configuration to
   the email address given below).

5. Run the keymap utility with the argument -m XX, where XX is
   a two character code describing your national keyboard. The
   valid codes are described in a termcap-like file
   /usr/share/misc/keycap. If you don't find a suitable entry or
   find mistakes in an existing one, you have to edit your own one,
   AND, THIS IS IMPORTANT, send this newly created or modified entry
   to the email address below, so that it can be integrated in the
   next release for the benefit of all users.

6. Further information available:
   - There are manpages available which roughly describe keymap, keycap,
     and co. See the source directories of keymap for man page files
     that are available with this version (Changes from version to version).
   - /usr/include/sys/ioctl_pc.h describes the programmer's interface
     to codrv.
   - /sys/i386/isa/codrv/co_hdr.h contains a number of user-changeable
     #defines.
   - If you need further help, or have found bugs, contact the email
     address below. Send fixes, if any to the same address. Don't
     send them to the patchkit coordinators, the patchkit mailing lists
     or to the Usenet comp.os.386bsd.* newsgroups, because any
     of these paths would delay processing. Usually I am reachable
     directly during work hours (0900-1800 GMT+1), so expect a fast reply
     then. This wouldn't be the case with the other channels.

Send all queries, bugs, fixes, improvements, comments, etc. to

	Holger.Veit@gmd.de (preferred)
	veit@du9ds3.fb9dv.uni-duisburg.de (less preferred)

7.  What is with X11?
    Codrv supports XFree86, but you may need a special server. XFree86-1.3
    which may be already available with the announcement of patchkit-0.2.4
    will support Codrv without changes. XFree86-1.2 needs to be
    recompiled. Compiled XFree86-1.2 servers are available from
    ftp.uni-duisburg.de:/pub/unix/386bsd-0.1/unofficial/codrv/x[cm]_012.z
    and bsd.coe.montana.edu:/pub/codrv/x[cm]_012.z.

    x[cm]_012.z denote the color(c) respectively mono(m) server and
    the files are gzipped tar archives.
