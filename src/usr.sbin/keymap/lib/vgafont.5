.Sh DESCRIPTION
This document describes the differences between the font format loadable by 
the
.Xr setfont 3
routine and the original bdf (bitmap distribution format) as used by
the X11 Windows System Release 5.
.Pp
In general, 
.Fn setfont
understands all keywords of the bdf file, but only uses a subset of them.
.Pp
The main restriction for usability of fonts is that the console is 
operated in text mode whereas the X11 Windows system uses 
graphics to display a character. Thus, a usable
font underlies the following limits:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
The bitmap of a character must be smaller than 8x16. Note that this fits for
a 3x5 font for instance; it is, however, not recommended to load such small
fonts, because this font is displayed in a 8x16 pixel map anyway, and thus
might look quite funny.
.It
The font should have fixed width, however, proportional fonts may be
loaded into the fixed grid, but look quite ugly then.
.It
A character set may contain a maximum of 256 entries. Together with the
facility of the console driver to load two fonts, there may be 512 different
characters displayed simultaneously. This is sufficient for most 
latin character sets (if you want to do word processing or TeX, use a
graphical video system).
.It
X11 uses a 16 bit encoding scheme similiar to the ISO 10646-1 Draft standard
to express a character code. 386bsd is currently based on a 8 bit scheme.
To allow more than 256 character codes and retaining 8 bit compatibility,
the console driver uses a pair of special codes to switch between fonts.
The code 
.Em 0x0e (SO)
enables the second font, the code
.Em 0x0f (SI)
switches back to the first (default) font. If no second font is loaded,
SI and SO are ignored.
.Pp
This handling of fonts and encoding is experimental, and may be modified
in the future, if a better scheme (UniCode, or ISO-DIS 10646 1.2) is 
available and standardized.
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLE
The following is a sample bdf font skeleton which is accepted by 
.Fn setfont .
It should not be misunderstood as an official description of the bdf font 
format.

The bdf font format is part of the MIT X11 distribution.
.Sh BUGS
The problem of languages writing right-to-left is not yet handled. Currently,
words in such a language must be prepared as an inverse character string.
