 * 29/07/92 -hv- copied and adapted from printcap common_source
 *
 * -hv-: Hey, after gettytab, termcap and printcap this is the fourth time, 
 * that this code has been adapted. Now, we should perhaps think about 
 * a universal capabilities library which unites all four and allows different 
 * data bases to be checked with a unified interface. This must be
 * documented of course in great detail. Any volunteers?

 *		process when large numbers of capabilities are given.
 * Note:	If we add a last pointer now we will screw up the
